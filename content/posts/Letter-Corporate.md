# Our Letter to Corporate
<!--more-->
***Good Afternoon,***

 ***I run a website wheresthehighrise.com and a blog dedicated to the search for this mythic pizza I remember from you guys circa 2006-2009 (not super sure on the exact date). I initially started this search a few years back and no one had ever heard of it on the /r/dominos subreddit. Even employees that had been with the company for years were unable to recall it and they were from all over the United States. I thought my search had ended in vain or perhaps I Quantum Leaped from another reality that had this amazing pizza into a bleak dystopian hellscape that was devoid of the delight and warmth the Highrise Pizza from Dominos had brought me.***

***I was inspired to pick up the mantle of the seeker again and try to nail something down that proved it had indeed existed, some promotional material that had a photo, or a training video or commercial that caught its miraculous visage. So I began the search anew when a mysterious benefactor reached out and said that it had indeed existed apparently as a test market offering and that there wouldnâ€™t be a lot to go on.***

***I feel that this clue is actually really helpful, or at least my fools heart wishes it to be. If anyone would have information or aid to lend to us on this journey, it would be the Sanctuary of Dominos Head Quarters.***

 ***So I reach out to you today in some fool-hearted attempt to get clarity and proof of this Chimerical Artifact!***

***Thank you for your time,***

 ***Shira N***
