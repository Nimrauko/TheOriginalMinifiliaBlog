# The Background

I have been searching for evidence this Pizza existed for many years now. In my Junior or Senior year of High School (2006-2007, but there is a possibility it was 2008-2009) I was a HUGE Dominos fan. I exclusively ate here when it came to Pizza.

The particular promotion I fell in love with was their "High Rise Pizza". It was a hand tossed pizza with cheddar baked into the crust. Not like a stuffed crust, but actually throughout the crust and on top of the crust. I always ordered the same thing, a Beef High Rise with a stuffed cheesy bread. I ordered this multiple times a month for quite some time.
I remember distinctly when this promotion ended the manager of my location said that even though it was gone he knew how to make it and as long as I ordered on his shifts he'd still make it for me as it was not hard to do.

Fast forward to a few years ago I am mentioning it to my husband and he doesn't remember it at all. So to google I go, and there is not a shred of proof it ever existed.
Finding this odd, I made my way to Reddit the land of deep knowledge and went to the Dominos subreddit. No one that had worked at Dominos, from several different places across the USA, had ever heard of it and they had been with the company at least as long back as I am remembering it existing. This cant possibly be true!

So I am hoping there is someone else that remembers this, or can get this search in front of someone at Dominos who has access to this knowledge. I am starting to feel like it existed in another timeline and I have somehow phased into another reality where it doesn't exist.
