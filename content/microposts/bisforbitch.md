An ode to honey b lovely

### "B is for Bitch" by Death Merchants of Eorzea

*(Verse 1)*  
B is for the buzz that’s driving us mad,  
Every sweet little smile just makes us more sad.  
You flutter through the air like you’re some kind of queen,  
But you’re nothing but a nuisance, the worst we’ve seen.  

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
We’ve had enough of your sugar-coated lies,  
Behind those bright eyes, a venomous disguise.  
Honey drips from your tongue, but it’s all fake,  
The bitter taste of your sweetness is more than we can take.  

*(Chorus)*  
B is for Bitch, and that’s just what you are,  
Spreading your poison, leaving scars.  
You think you’re so lovely, with your sugary flair,  
But we see through it all, and we just don’t care.  

*(Verse 2)*  
You lead your little bees, your swarm of deceit,  
But we’re coming for you, prepare for defeat.  
No more honeyed words, no more dancing around,  
We’ll tear off those wings, bring you down to the ground.  

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
We’ve seen enough of your sticky, sweet charade,  
Your charm is just a blade that cuts both ways.  
Honey B Lovely, it’s time to face the truth,  
The only thing that’s sweet is the end of your ruse.  

*(Chorus)*  
B is for Bitch, and that’s just what you are,  
Spreading your poison, leaving scars.  
You think you’re so lovely, with your sugary flair,  
But we see through it all, and we just don’t care.  

*(Bridge)*  
We’re the Death Merchants, we don’t play nice,  
We’ll crush your hive, no matter the price.  
You can buzz all you want, but your time is done,  
We’re the dark that’ll blot out your sun.  

*(Final Chorus)*  
B is for Bitch, and that’s just what you are,  
Spreading your poison, leaving scars.  
You think you’re so lovely, with your sugary flair,  
But we see through it all, and we just don’t care.  

*(Outro)*  
So fly away, Honey B, while you still can,  
Before the Death Merchants take your final stand.  
B is for Bitch, and you’ll remember this tune,  
When we crush your hive beneath the blackened moon.
