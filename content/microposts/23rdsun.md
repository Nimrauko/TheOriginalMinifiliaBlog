# 23rd Sun of the 3rd Umbral Moon

I arrived in Gridania this morning and was greeted by the Elder Seed-Seer. We patrolled Gridania and she brought me up to speed with the status of the Elementals, and their growing calm. It seems all is well as well with their beastmen. 

We discussed at length my upcoming trip to the New World. Our meeting truly left me with a sense of renewed peace knowing that after all the trials and tribulations thee past few years, meant something. Eorzea was no longer at constant war with the beastment and dealing with stolen caches of Aether Rich Crystals and Primal summonings. Kan-E-Senna even relayed that sightings of the Elder Primal Odin have dwindled. 

After a brief lunch at the Carline Canopy, I rented a Chocobo and set off through the Blue Badger Gate into the Central Shroud. Through the South Shroud and then to the East, and eventually through the North Shroud I took in the Golden Light dancing through the veil of the towering forest, like threads of pure fairy gold. Long many days were spent here in the Shroud. Putting down vilekin and voidsent. Dealing with things forgotten by the Amdapori and Gelmorans. How long would it be before I set foot beneath these trees again?

After stopping for a spell at the Bobbing Cork, I made my way onwards towards Coerthas. Perhaps my fortunes were less than I had envisioned, as upon entering from the Shroud I was met with a Blizzard that forced me to go no further for the day, and shelter at Oberservatorium rather than press on to Camp Dragonhead. Should the blizzard pass by morning I will be able to take a Zu to Ishgard to see Lord Aymeric, then to Idyllshire and then Kugane before returning by Air Ship to Limsa on the 28th Sun of the 3rd Umbral Moon to depart for Tural.
