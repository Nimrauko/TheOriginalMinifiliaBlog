# 22nd Sun of the 3rd Umbral Moon

I arrived in the lower decks of Limsa Lominsa early this morning. I had a few drinks in the Drowning Wench and met with a few friends before heading out to begin my tour through Vylbrand. 

Seeing the vast seas surrounding the Island got me to thinking about the impending voyage to the new world. Remembering when I firs set foot on this Island a couple years ago, the excitement I felt, the bonds I forged. Even after all this time I found myself coming back to Limsa whenever I had spare time. The wiley nature of the Limsans always paired well with my own bawdy sensibilities.

Perhaps the best thing of this particular trip was seeing the positive relations with the beast tribes. There were many miles to go in terms of where I would ideally like to see relations, but when the members of the Maelstrom are working side by side with the Beastmen instead of taking up sword against, that is a victory.

I ended my tour back at Limsa Lominsa, at Maelstrom Command. I wished to see my Squadron one last time before I made  my way to the Black Shroud. My squadron, the best rag tag group of Lalafell in Eorzea, eagerly greeted me. They had come so far from the discontended ruffians who my superiors sent to me. They had matured, learned discipline, and had become to each other and myself, family. 

Once we had said all that needed to be said, I made my way to the Airship Landing to Gridania. First I will see the Elder Seedseer and then make my way through the shroud to Coerthas where I will stay at Camp Dragonhead before heading into Ishgard and beyond. Till Sea Swalls All
