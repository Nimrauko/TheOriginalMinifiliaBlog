# 72 Hours Remain...well kind of

![Dawn of the final day](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53816215830_3e8d75c4b0_k.jpg)

So in roughly 57 hours from the writing of this post, Warriors of light from all over the world will be heading to the New World to have marvelous new adventures with old friends and those we have yet to meet. The anticipation is palpable in the community.

We wont hear from Mini today but instead you will hear from me (Shira!). But I know if she were here to talk to us, she would also be sharing her excitement for what lies ahead of us.

There will be new Dungeons, Trials, Raids (Both normal/savage and the 24man), beast tribes, classes to level, achievements to be earned. I hope you all have a fantastic launch, and remember to stay hydrated and to eat some food! Don't feel you have to rush to the end. We wont have the harder content for two weeks so please enjoy the wonderfully crafted story Yoshi-P and the team have made for us.

While we are nearing the start to the 48 hour Maintanence, what do you plan to do with the down time? I posed this question on Mastodon last night, but I am still curious to know what everyone will be doing :)

For me, Napping and playing Elden Ring will pass my 48 hour torture. 

Oh before I go, please be respectful and kind (As I know our community can be) and refrain from posting spoilers on social media and in Discords. Not everyone is going to be able to jump in during early access as soon as the servers go up. 

Well with that I bid thee farewell and will see you Friday morning!!
