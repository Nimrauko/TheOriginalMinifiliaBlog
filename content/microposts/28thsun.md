# 28th sun of the 3rd Umbral Moon

I took the first boat to Old Sharlayan and arrived this morning. I made my way swiftly the Baldesian Annex to meet with Krile and Graha and to finalize our plans before we set sail tomorrow. 

Once done with our meeting I plan on stopping in Labyrinthos to say my farewells to the Gleaners and Residents I had aided over the past few months. Then I will make my way to the Studium to see Debroye for some of her Archon Loaves, which are amongst the best I have ever had.

To top off my last day, I shall have a nice read in the Scholars Harbor. The fresh sea breeze and the rythmic sway of the waters will give me a nice respite before the chaos that I know will inevitably be awaiting me tomorrow.
