# Greetings and welcome!! This will be OOC. Everywhere else in the blog will be Mini Filia. But this little section will be from me. 

&nbsp;  

So a bit about me: I started playing Final Fantasy 14 during the beta before the relaunch as A Realm Reborn. I was hooked from the start. The world was gorgeous and engaging and the characters we were introduced to had such depth and the story was super engaging. I also met loads of amazing people in game over the years from all over the world. 

&nbsp;  

Our characters went on amazing adventures and faced many challenges. These bonds extended well outside of the game as well. Friends went through real life trials and tribulations, and we weathered them together the best we could. There were births, deaths, weddings and the like. 

&nbsp;  

A year or two into my time in FFXIV I decided to make a Lalafell version of my favorite Character, and in my honest opinion the BEST character, Minfilia. As she was a tiny Lala I figured Mini Filia was the most appropriate name for her. Thus my alter ego was born. As an Alt-o-holic I made Mini Filias on multiple servers, but many have laid dormant, as I only have so much free time T.T

&nbsp;  

Mane Filia (Former Lala, Future Hrothgar) of Goblin, Mini Filia of Halicarnassus and Mini Filia of Cuchulainn are my "Mains". This blog will be focusing on the life and adventures of Halicarnassus's Mini Filia.
